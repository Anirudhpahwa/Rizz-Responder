# AI Rizz Responder

A small project that generates Gen Z–style “rizz” replies using an LLM. You give it context and a tone, and it spits out a smooth response you can send.

This is mainly meant for fun, but it’s built in a way that keeps responses consistent, respectful, and not weird.

## What it does

- Generates flirty / playful replies
- Lets you pick a tone (playful, confident, chaotic, etc.)
- Uses a custom system prompt so responses stay on vibe
- Keeps things non-explicit and safe by default

## Tones

"Playful", "Sweet", "Confident", "Supportive", "Angry",  
"Chaotic", "Flirty", "Dry Humor", "Sarcastic", "Wholesome",  
"Bold", "Teasing", "Mysterious", "Simp Mode", "Ironic",  
"Cool & Detached", "Over-the-Top", "Soft Rizz", "Smooth",  
"Goofy", "Witty", "Calm", "Respectful", "Eager", "Nonchalant"

## How it works

The app sends a system prompt that defines the model as a “rizz responder.”  
From there, it just takes:
- whatever message or situation you give it
- the tone you select

and returns a reply that matches the vibe. No explanations, no meta text — just the response.

Note: This project avoids NSFW stuff and anything creepy on purpose.
If you want to fork it and take it in a different direction, go for it.
